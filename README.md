Automated Fruit Detection: In an era of automation, our project addresses the need for accurate and efficient fruit detection in images.
Color Analysis Importance: We leverage the power of color analysis to distinguish fruits from their backgrounds, a fundamental aspect of fruit recognition.
Real-world Applications: Our system finds applications in agriculture, quality control, and inventory management, streamlining processes and reducing manual effort.
Key Objectives: Our main goals are to design an advanced detection system, apply color analysis techniques, and showcase the potential of MATLAB in image analysis and automation.
